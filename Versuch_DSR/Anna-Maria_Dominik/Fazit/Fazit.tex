\chapter{Summary}
In summary, the results do not agree satisfactorily with the literature values.
As already mentioned in the evaluation, this is mainly due to the inaccurate method of determining the wavelength and the resulting frequencies.
The lines of the isotopes could not be clearly determined.\\
Nevertheless, it is important to follow up with the fine and hyperfine structures as well as with 
energy levels. 
With that experiment it was possible to apply our theoretical knowledge about the nuclear and atom structures.
