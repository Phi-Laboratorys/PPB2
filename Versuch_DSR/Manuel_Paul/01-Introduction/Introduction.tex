Spectroscopy is a very important tool to discover the structure from atoms and molecules. With the help of that tool, the physicists discover the spectral lines of the H-atom. This is where spectroscopy began. \\
The research in this are also helps to discover things like fine and hyperfine structure. What finaly leads to Quantum mechanics.\\
Furthermore, spectroscopy is also very useful tool for other areas of science like chemistry or biology. In this areas spectroscopy helps to analyze probes and provides information about which materials the probe is made of.\\
So the aim of this Experiment is to get in contact with experimental atom and nucleus physics by means of Doppler-free  Saturation Spectroscopy of Rubidium.
