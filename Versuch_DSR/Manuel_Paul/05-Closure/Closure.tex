In the experiment and the following evaluation of the measured data it becomes clear that the measurement have to be very precisely to detect the small transitions for the hyperfine structure. In the evaluation itself we learned how to fit functions on our measured data, and we get a good overview in the handling of precise measured data.\\
Overall this experiment gave us a good insight into the topic of saturation spectroscopy and it was a pleasure to see how theory becomes reality.
